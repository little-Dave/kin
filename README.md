## Kin
The best parts of life are oft defined by memories we make with other people — memories we hold in our hearts and feel deeply. Every once in a while, years will go by before something — a smell, a song, the color of the sky — jogs a forgotten one. Document it. Here. Let's spend more time reminding ourselves what life is really about. Spend more time celebrating your kin.

Current functionality is limited — all photos shown in GIF demos are seeded data, and demonstrate the app's intent. 
Still, feel free to clone and check it out if you'd like. The API is available here: https://github.com/little-Dave/kin_api.
The seeded data belong to username: dave password: test.
